        question: "What is an e‑Challan?",
        answer:
            "An e‑Challan is a digitally generated traffic challan issued by the traffic department when a rule is violated, such as overspeeding, signal jumping, or not wearing a seat belt. It is recorded in the system and can be viewed and paid online.",
    },
    {
        question: "How can I check if my vehicle has any pending e‑Challans?",
        answer:
            "Go to the e‑Challan section, enter your vehicle registration number and, if required, your driving licence or chassis number. The system will show all pending challans with date, location, and violation details.",
    },
    {
        question: "Can I pay my e‑Challan online through this website?",
        answer:
            "Yes. After you fetch your e‑Challan details, you can select one or multiple challans and pay them instantly using UPI, debit or credit cards, net banking, or your wallet balance on our platform.",
    },
    {
        question: "How long does it take for the paid e‑Challan status to update?",
        answer:
            "In most cases, the status is updated immediately or within a few minutes after successful payment. Sometimes it may take a few hours for the traffic department’s system to reflect the updated status.",
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I do not pay my e‑Challan on time?",
        answer:
            "If an e‑Challan remains unpaid beyond the due date, penalties may increase and the case can be forwarded to the traffic court. Continued non‑payment can also lead to issues during vehicle fitness, insurance renewal, or RC/DL related services.",
    },
    //   {
    //     question: "I think the e‑Challan issued to my vehicle is wrong. What should I do?",
    //     answer:
    //       "If you find incorrect vehicle details, violation type, or evidence, use the dispute or grievance option linked with the challan or contact the respective state traffic department. Share clear proof such as timestamps, location details, or vehicle documents when raising your complaint.",
    //   },
    //   {
    //     question: "Can I pay e‑Challans for multiple vehicles from one account?",
    //     answer:
    //       "Yes. You can add and manage multiple vehicles from a single account. The dashboard lets you switch between vehicles, view their pending e‑Challans, and clear all dues digitally.",
    //   },
    //   {
    //     question: "Is it safe to pay e‑Challans online on this platform?",
    //     answer:
    //       "Payments are processed through secure, encrypted gateways. Your card, UPI, or banking details are handled by the payment provider and are not stored on our servers, ensuring a safe payment experience.",
    //   },
    //   {
    //     question: "Will I receive a receipt after paying my e‑Challan?",
    //     answer:
    //       "Yes. Once the payment is successful, a digital receipt is generated with the transaction ID and challan reference. You can download it immediately and later access it anytime from the Transactions or History section.",
    //   },
    //   {
    //     question: "Will I get alerts for new e‑Challans raised on my vehicle?",
    //     answer:
    //       "If you enable notifications, you will receive SMS, email, or in‑app alerts whenever a new e‑Challan is issued against your registered vehicle number, helping you clear dues on time.",
    //   },
