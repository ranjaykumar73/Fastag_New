  {
    question: "What is FASTag and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "FASTag is an RFID tag linked to your vehicle and wallet. When you pass a FASTag-enabled toll plaza, the tag is scanned and the toll amount is auto-debited from your linked balance without stopping.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I check if my vehicle has any pending e‑Challans?",
    answer:
      "Enter your vehicle registration number on the e‑Challan page of our website. The system will fetch and display all pending challans along with date, location, and violation details.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pay my e‑Challan directly from this website?",
    answer:
      "Yes. After you search your vehicle, you can select one or multiple pending e‑Challans and pay them online using UPI, debit or credit cards, net banking, or your wallet balance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I recharge my FASTag using your platform?",
    answer:
      "Go to the FASTag Recharge section, enter your vehicle or tag ID, choose a recharge amount, and complete the payment using UPI, cards, net banking, or wallet. The recharge is usually reflected within a few seconds.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why is my FASTag showing as blacklisted?",
    answer:
      "FASTag is marked blacklisted when the balance falls below the minimum threshold or when there is an issue with your tag or KYC. Recharging the tag or updating pending KYC details normally removes the blacklist status automatically.",
  },
//   {
//     question: "How do I check my FASTag balance?",
//     answer:
//       "You can check balance by entering your vehicle number or registered mobile number in the FASTag Balance section. The current available balance and recent deductions will be shown on the screen.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Is FASTag mandatory for all vehicles?",
//     answer:
//       "FASTag is mandatory for most four‑wheeler vehicles at national highway toll plazas. Vehicles without FASTag usually have to pay double toll or use separate cash lanes where available.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "What happens if there is no balance in my FASTag while crossing a toll?",
//     answer:
//       "If your FASTag does not have sufficient balance, the transaction may be declined and the tag can get blacklisted. In such cases, the toll plaza may charge you cash or a penalty. Keeping your tag balance topped up avoids such issues.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "How secure are online payments made on this website?",
//     answer:
//       "All payments are processed through PCI‑DSS compliant payment gateways with encrypted connections. Card, UPI, and banking details are handled by the payment provider and are not stored on our servers.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Can I download receipts for my e‑Challan and FASTag payments?",
//     answer:
//       "Yes. After every successful payment, a digital receipt is generated. You can view and download past receipts anytime from the Transactions or History section in your profile.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Can I manage multiple vehicles from a single account?",
//     answer:
//       "You can link multiple vehicles and their tags to one account. The dashboard lets you switch between vehicles, view individual challans, and monitor toll expenses for each vehicle separately.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "What should I do if challan details shown are incorrect?",
//     answer:
//       "If you notice a wrong vehicle, amount, or violation, do not pay immediately. Use the dispute or raise‑query option provided with the challan details, or contact the respective state traffic department with proof for correction.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Will I get notifications for new e‑Challans or low FASTag balance?",
//     answer:
//       "If you enable alerts, you will receive SMS, email, or in‑app notifications whenever a new e‑Challan is raised against your vehicle or when your FASTag balance falls below a set threshold.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Can I transfer my FASTag to a new vehicle?",
//     answer:
//       "FASTag is generally issued for a specific vehicle and registration number, so it cannot be directly transferred. For a new vehicle, you usually need to close the old tag and apply for a new one, then link it again in your account.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "How do I contact support if my payment is successful but the challan still shows unpaid?",
//     answer:
//       "Go to the Help or Support section, submit a ticket with your transaction ID, payment time, and vehicle number, or use live chat/helpline if available. The support team will verify the payment with the gateway and update the status.",
//   },
